*Boku no Piko* (*Boku no Piko*, lit. *My Pico*) is a Japanese series of shotacon anime OVAs produced by Natural High. The producer has described it as "the world's first shotacon anime" and it was made primarily to be marketed to and appeal to a male audience of Japanese shotacons. The series consists of three episodes and an edited version of the first episode. The series spawned a one-shot manga, a computer game and a music video album. Because of the high cost of producing anime, the characters and contents were intensively product-tested before production began.
**Episode 1)** An effeminate boy named Pico works at his grandfather's cafe during the summer, hoping to make some friends. He soon meets a man named Tamotsu "Mokkun", who seduces him, believing him to be a girl. Later at Mokkun's house, Pico asks Mokkun what he thinks of him, but he doesn't respond. Pico runs away and cuts his hair. Mokkun searches for him, and the two reconcile at the end of the episode.
**Episode 2)** Pico finds a boy named Chico swimming nude in a stream, and the two become friends. Later at Chico's house, Chico takes Pico to his attic, where the two spy on Chico's sister masturbating. Pico then shows Chico that boys can also do this, and the two have sex.
**Episode 3)** Pico and Chico meet a pretty, feminine-looking runaway named Coco who lives in a hideout underneath the subway. Pico slowly begins to fall in love with Coco, causing him to question his feelings for Chico. The situation becomes exacerbated when Pico catches Coco and Chico having relations one night. Eventually, they reconcile, having a threesome atop Tokyo Tower.
