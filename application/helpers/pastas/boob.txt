On this beautiful day, we of humanity have been blessed with a gift from the gods, a boon to which all of us must revere. It would not be an exaggeration to say that these nips have blessed me with its grace, brought me to salvation, and left me with eternal happiness within me. Without the presence of these blooming buds, the breasts would only be two mountains of warmth - they would still be impressive, most definitely, but incomplete. They nurture life, they are the wells to an elixer that few are able to lay their hands on, and they are the path to a brighter future. May there come a day when these blessing are not seen as immoral in our society, but as something to honor. Join the cause, comrade, and rally the men so that we can free these treasures from under the cloth in which it is so heavily guarded, and from the newborns who dare to monopolize them! Rage my men, scream my men, fight my men!
