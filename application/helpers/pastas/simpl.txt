You fool. You utter braindead simpleton. You truly thought your hackneyed, half-washed points would have any impact on this argument? Please. After a series of quantum equations (yes, I received a master's degree in physics at age 17) I have confirmed that under every possible universe imaginable, you are crying tears of regret because you know you're helpless to the power of my vigorous intellectualizationism. In fact, I'm willing to bet if I were even around you, your entire existence would be eradicated by the sheer massive size and scope of my brainistic waves.The sheer fact that you even thought you could challenge a being like me in the realm of logical debate is laughable. At least, I would say that if I laughed. I don't; rather I spend my free time on the internet confusing helpless dolts like you with my vastly superior vocabulary.
