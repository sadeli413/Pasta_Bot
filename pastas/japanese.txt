In case you misunderstood, I was speaking japanese, the language which is used in Japanese animation cartoons known as anime. I have not wielded upon you, the complicated and hard to decipher writing script used in the aforementioned language; instead I have transliterated the Japanese words into Roman script, not due to any lack of knowledge on my part in Japanese scripts, but for your uncultured mind to comprehend. I am not planning on explaining what the words mean, as I shouldn't have to explain everything in your language, as it is neither superior, nor more expressive than sacred japanese.
