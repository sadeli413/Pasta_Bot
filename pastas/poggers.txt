Guys I'll be honest, I fucking hate the word poggers. It's not funny, it's not quirky, it's stupid. It's just an Asian man going gasp!. It is not funny and I do not enjoy looking at it. Whenever someone says poggers out loud I'm just like "I get it you use fucking twitch. You know basic mother fucking memes. Now shut the FUCK up for ONCE" it's stupid. It's so mother fucking stupid. If anyone goes up to me and goes "haha that's poggers" I will break their KNEECAPS and make the birds watch. Wanna know why? Because poggers isn't fucking FUNNY it is not funny and or quirky. If you use it so be it, but just know I'm judging you. I'm judging you agressively. It's not funny, doesn't make me go HAAHAA it makes me go want to drink bleach because that is the most ununique phrase. It's stupid. It's stupid and whatever you say cannot change my mind. Look at this mother fucker. How is this funny? How is this at any point relatable? How is this just valid at all? It's a guy. Just a guy making a face. It's what Lele pons aspires from. It's a funny haahaa face, and if you laugh at it you consume any content from a former vinestar wether it's actual good content or things with as much entertainment as shit floating in the toilet bowl. Look at it. It's just a wacky face and people say this on a daily. Really? REALLY? fucking KAPPA is better than this. REALLY? This is what human comedy has come to? I see shit like this everywhere like good human content that I laugh at, and this is the peak of human comedy? This is what everyone says when you do a good job? Really? When I hear this I think "I must've done something wrong with my life" instead of "that was a good moment". This is amazing. Truly, amazing. thankyou jake, very cool.
