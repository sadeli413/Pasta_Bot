Ok look, I'm not a weeb, I just have a katana collection and I fuck my underage wife. (DON'T CALL HER A PILLOW) but, trust me I'm not a weeb. I just hate it when people complain that I say kawaii every 5 seconds but, I only do it every 10 seconds. These uncultured assholes should know about Japanese culture like me. They get uncomfortable when I wear my cosplay suits. Like guys, stop being so inconsiderate. So today, I am going to the Anti-Defamation Organization to get this harassment known. So next time you call me a weeb, you are not only being a racist fat pig, but you are also gonna bring the wrath of LIBERALISM!
