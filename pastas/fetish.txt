A fetish does not make you a creep. For instance, people can be turned on by incest porn, but not want to fuck their own sister. Furries don't often want to fuck animals. And PLENTY of people like porn that involves cheating or rape, but would NEVER do those. Just so, loli fans aren't just a bunch of pedos (though statistically maybe a few probably are, but you could say that about any fetish). For instance, I'm a loli fan myself, but I have an 8 year old daughter who regularly brings friends over, and not ONCE (I swear) have I seen a single one of them in a sexual light. I'm attracted to the cute designs and innocent attitudes of lolis, that doesn't mean I'm gonna go fuck children, that's obviously fucking disgusting. Not to mention, most lolis are legal, it's the design, NOT the age that makes a loli.
