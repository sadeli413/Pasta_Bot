Hey you, you're finally awake. You were trying to lewd the lolis, right? Same as us, and that weeb over there. Damn you FBI. Anime was fine until you came along. Community was nice and lazy. If it wasn't for you, I could have pirated those shows and been halfway to Akihabara. You there, you and me, we don't belong here. It's these lewders the FBI wants. We're all Neets and otakus in binds now, weeb. Shut up back there! And what's wrong with him, huh? Watch your tongue! You're speaking to Shadman, the true loli king! Shadman? The lewder of lolis? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they've captured you...oh gods, where are they taking us? I don't know where we're going. But another world awaits. No. This can't be happening! This isn't happening! Hey, which waifu do you worship, weeb? Why do you care? A weeb's last thoughts should be of his waifu. Zero Two, I'm...I'm with Zero Two. Director Wray, sir, the executioner is ready! Good. Let's get this over with. Holo, Kaname, Haruhi, Chitoge, Nep...divines, please help me! Look at him, Christopher Wray, the FBI director. And it looks like the UN are with him. Damn nations. I bet they had something to do with this. Why are we stopping? Why do you think? End of the line. Let's go. Shouldn't keep the other world waiting for us. No, wait, we're not lewders! Face your reincarnation with some courage, weeb. You've got to tell them! We weren't with you! This is a mistake! Step towards the truck when we call your name. One at a time! FBI loves their damn lists. Shadman, lewder of lolis. It has been an honor, lord Shadman! Holofan of Animemes. Shit_Taste of Zero Two's clan. No! I'm not a lewder! You can't do this! Halt! You're not gonna kill me! Snipers! GAAH! Anyone else feel like running? Wait. You there, step forward. Who are you?
