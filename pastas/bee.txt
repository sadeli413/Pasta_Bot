Worker bees are the ultimate simp. They spend their whole life donating pollen for the queen bee that probably doesn't even acknowledge their existence (she's literally their queen) and ensure their queen's children and larvae remain safe at all times. All while having 0 chance as they are literally being unable to reproduce these people donating $100 a month to pokimane are nothing compared to the omegasimp known as the worker bee.
