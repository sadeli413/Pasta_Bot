So it seems you've tested positive for the Chinese virus, the so-called Covid NINETEEN, the Corona-nobody knows what to call it, quite frankly. It's the most amazing thing, no one knew anything about Corona until a few weeks ago. But the moment I heard about it-the Wuhan flu; it's also the Wuhan, or WuHAAN-that's a city in China. Many people don't know that. But the moment I heard about this Chinese flu, I ordered a test. And it's an amazing test. We do better testing than anywhere in the world. Some say the Germans have the best tests, but they don't. Our tests are even better. So you're positive for Corona. And usually "positive" is a positive word-it's a very good word, frankly. Everybody thinks it's good, apart from what you hear on the news-which is fake. It's largely fake. But in medicine, "positive" is not so good. So it's very confusing. And I've always been very clear about that. Some say "positive" is always good, but I've never agreed with that. So you're positive for the Corona. But you'll be fine. Totally fine. You might think you're going to die-and everybody does die, eventually. But you'll be fine. You feel fine, right? You won't need a ventilator. There are no ventilators-but you won't need one. How old are you, 55? You won't need one. Some people need a ventilator, and they're amazing machines. Did you know the first ventilator was made by Henry Ford? It's an incredible piece of equipment. But you'll be fine. The virus gets into your lungs, which is where you breathe. But you have two of them. Some say you have a spare. Some people only have one lung. It's true. But I don't talk about spares. I always want both. Given a choice, I want two lungs. So I've asked nurse-what's your name, Nancy?-I've asked nurse Nancy to keep you comfortable. And Nancy is one of our finest nurses. I mean, just look at her. Incredible, right? Nancy, you're really incredible. You're not afraid of Corona, are you, the Chinese Plague? I didn't think so.
