I've been part of the furry community for probably 9 years, longer than most people have even been on the internet. I developed my fursona over that time period and spent probably $10k on all the materials and 200 hours, so $25k total. I've been to 15 different furry conventions, two of which were invite only, and I've been a speaker at 4 of them. If I quit my job and became a full-time furry instead I would easily be a pillar of the community within months, probably the most famous furry of all time by the time I retired. This is literally my life bro, I don't appreciate people denying my existence like that.
