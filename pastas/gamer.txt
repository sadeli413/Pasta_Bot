A most definite yes. Gamers are the most oppressed minority in all of America. Why? Well listen to this. The government has limited imports and product of G-fuel and G-fuel like products. Which is an important gamer substance. The government has also labeled us as mass shooters, women haters, nazis, and fat for years. This is not our fault as being fat is hereditary. The government has amended the Constitution to enable them to cover up or remove anything that they deem, and I quote, "cringe". Naturally the government would include 99% of gamer content out there as part of this category. And last but not least. The government has been proven to blame gamers for climate change due to their extensive sweat and g fuel consumption causing litter and increased levels of saline moisture to get absorbed into our atmosphere. This is not our fault as sweating is natural in high stress situations, such as when you are little Mac and your are more than 2 feet away from the ledge. I hope my answer has enlightened your mind on the situation of the gamer minority and encouraged action to be taken.
