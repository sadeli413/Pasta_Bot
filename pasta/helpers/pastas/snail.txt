I've had a fish tank for almost a year now. I started with 20 snails, and over the course of this year each generation of snail has had daily mass orgies. Now we are probably like on the 50th-60th snail generation. Even quite possibly more than that. Hundreds and hundreds of snails have been born and died. They have become SO inbred that they are now so depressed and slow that they can no longer really move or eat or reproduce like their sexy relatives had once before. Now their numbers are decreasing drastically. Some snails are born over the shells of their deceased inbred relatives and they don't even make it off the pile of the lost before they themselves pass. It is truly a hell of my own unintentional creation. They thought they could just have huge kinky snail orgies on the regular with no ramifications, but they never thought about the future. They failed to recognize the drastic ramifications of banging the same 20 snails confined to their small 10 gallon glass prison. They only sought to indulge in sin, and now their severely depressed, inbred children must pay the ultimate price.
