I did an epic troll on my normie class My class if full of NORMIES! So I trolled them So we had a substitute teacher and he went to get something from the back room. I decided to pin a picture of small Keanu Reeves along with big Chungus on the wall. Everyone starts saying (Here comes Joe Joe reference) "MUDA MUDA MUDA!" My class starts yelling at me calling me autistic because they don't know memes. The sub comes back and sees Keanu Chungus and this happens. Sub: Who did this Me: Oh I think it was Joe Sub: What? Me: JOE Mama I start Rolf (rolling on the floor laughing) and Xding (XD is an emoticon for laughing, better than cancer emojis FYI.) My sub gives the entire class lunch detention and everyone is mad at me but at least it was epic lol. Just wish people were more cultured in Reddit. I'd like to remind everyone that after school everyone was talking shit abt me. So I stood in front of them on the planter T posing going "mmmmmmmmmmm" and "DOOT DOOT." Fucking everyone calls me a weirdo. I see a group of kids on their phones, so I walked and they were playing Fortnite like fa*gots (term by 4chan). So I call them a bunch of autists and how Minecraft is better. They walked away like a bunch fucking noons. People STARE at me when I tap them saying "CREEPER...." It's a Minecraft parody that's not that bad musically but they're supposed to respond with "Aww man." But nobody ever does.
