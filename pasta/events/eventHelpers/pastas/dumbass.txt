I'm no normal dumbass, I was born for it- a natural even. I took 0 years training in the art of dumbassery and I'm already one of the finest dumbasses this world has ever seen. I am classically untrained in several of the dumbass arts and I assure you that I excel in each and every one. there is no one dumber than me, scratch that, no one will ever be dumber than me. I am God's magnum opus, the perfect idiot. There is nothing I can't do wrong. I can get every question wrong in a multiple question test, without not failing. I won the most likely to not succeed prize of my school by the largest long shot you could possibly imagine. My idiocy is so strong that it generates its own field of dickery that warps others perceptions of right and wrong. I am the coming storm.
