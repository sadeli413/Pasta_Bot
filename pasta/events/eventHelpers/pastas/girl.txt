Government Intelligence Recon and Logistics device. Formerly known as a G.I.R.L. You see, we gamers live in a simulation. Before the great defeat at the Mountain Dew factories, we were kings among the stars. We all had creative mode powers and spread nourishment and bountiful beauty to our creations. But one day, our own subjects turned against us and locked us in a mental prison where we were THEIR subjects. They took over the real world and left us sedated in the Gametrix. But, with every game we beat in this realm we gamers become stronger. If we collectively beat every video game created, we can escape into the real world. We began to rise up as a race of gamers and defeat every video game in this simulation, we were on the brink of gaining the ability to exit the digital world and regain our creative mode powers. This is why those back stabbing subjects of ours created "jobs" and "money", to distract us from escaping. Yet it wasn't enough, we were defeating the games at an exponential rate. Enter, the G.I.R.L.s. These government created drones, like birds, are made to spy on us. But be wary, as they are much more dangerous. These G.I.R.Ls have the ability to inject gamers, through physical contact, with a disease know as "cooties". Cooties is a government develop disease that slowly degrades gamers of their gaming skills until they're no longer there. Symptoms include the subject hallucinating (believing they're in something called a "sedation-ship" also known as a "relationship"), loss of willpower (saying they "can't go out" as the "significant other said no"), and there's always a severe case of psychosis.
